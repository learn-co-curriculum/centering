# Centering Elements with CSS

## Problem Statement

In constructing a layout and various layout elements, centering in the "unknown"
will be needed often to align elements in the center of a page without giving fixed
values that may not work for various screen sizes. How is this possible when elements
can only be "floated" left or right?

## Objectives
1. Use `margin: auto` to create centered elements

## Conclusion

By setting the width of a block-level element, you will prevent it from stretching to the
full width of a screen. With the left and right margins set to auto, the element will center
within the browser. The only issue with this is when the element is wider than the browser window.
We will discuss later on how to adjust for this limitation.
